## ✨ What is Starpulse?

**Starpulse** is a light and thoughtful mobile app designed to give you a **daily dose of motivation, hope, and clarity** — all wrapped in a one-word prediction and a bite-sized inspirational quote. Whether you're navigating your day or simply need a moment of reflection, Starpulse is here to spark a smile.

## 🪐 Rooted in Tamil Astrology

**Tamil** is one of the world’s oldest living languages — and with it comes a timeless tradition of **astronomy and astrology**. For generations, Tamil culture has looked to celestial movements and planetary alignments to guide decision-making and predict auspicious moments.

At the heart of this practice lies the **Tamil daily calendar** (often referred to as **Panchangam**), a rich source of astrological insights based on lunar and solar cycles. These daily predictions, still revered and followed across Tamil communities, form the **baseline** for our app's predictions.

## 🤖 Powered by Generative AI

Starpulse builds on this cultural wisdom using **cutting-edge GenAI**. Each day, your **zodiac sign** and your self-inputs — how you're feeling, your energy, and your surroundings — help us craft a unique **one-word fortune** paired with a **motivational quote** tailored for you.

It's not random. It's a blend of **data, emotion, tradition, and modern intelligence** — all in under 10 seconds.

---

## 💙 Honesty, Purpose & Joy

While Starpulse includes ads to sustain development, our core mission is **emotional wellbeing**. We built this app to **make people feel better**, even if it’s just a tiny moment of uplift in their day.

We don’t promise to change your life — but we hope to **brighten it**, one word at a time.
